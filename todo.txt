TODO:

startup issues:
1. fht sync
2. when sync finished, fht set 0 30

runtime issues:
3. if no fht set issued within some timeout, set to 30 (and in FHEM enforce repetitive fht sets within the timeout)
4. consider restart command

5. consider (2-color?) LED blinking green when all OK and red when some problem appears (?)

6. logging issuies:
all prints must be of the form
MSG x1=Ôvalue1Õ x2=Ôvalue2Õ - messages to be parsed by FHEM
<CMD> <copy of params> - confirmation of what (fht/tmp) commands was issued
LOG <verboselevel> message
# auxiliary messages
> - command prompt
